Problem:
- Original error: "More input link labels specified for filter 'adelay' than it has inputs: 2 > 1"
- Caused by: Too many segments (138) creating overly complex filter_complex
- FFmpeg has limitations on filter complexity

Solution Applied:
1. Limit segments to 50 maximum
2. Use different approaches based on segment count:
   - â‰¤20 segments: Individual adelay filters (original method)
   - >20 segments: Create delayed files first, then mix

Benefits:
- Prevents FFmpeg filter complexity errors
- Maintains timing accuracy
- Handles large numbers of segments gracefully
- Better error handling and logging

Test Results:
- SRT segments: 109
- Expected behavior: Should work without filter complexity errors
- Fallback: If too many segments, limit to 50 and continue

Next Steps:
1. Test with real video upload
2. Monitor segment count in logs
3. Verify timing accuracy with limited segments
4. Check if 50 segment limit is sufficient
